# Techlore Criteria ‚òëÔ∏è
The following criteria gives visitors an idea of how we select services in our [resources.](https://techlore.tech/resources) The criteria is not perfect, but rather designed to share what we generally look for. There are rare situations where a service hits all criteria and remains unlisted *(ex. due to legal issues)* - and there are situations where a service doesn't hit all criteria but remains listed. *(ex. due to an absence of better options)*

## 1 - Open Source üåê
Open source isn't everything, but it adds a massive layer of transparency & oversight; open source services undergo a level of scrutiny rarely found in proprietary software. It's worth acknowledging the importance of open source varies depending on the context: For example, open source cryptography is more important than a DNS service open sourcing their web app *(which has little to do with the privacy/security offered by the DNS provider itself)*

## 2 - Strong Privacy Protections üïµÔ∏è
This will mean different things in different contexts. Broadly, we do our best to select services that offer strong privacy protections from the service itself *(ex. Browsers that don't track their own users)* **and** that offer strong privacy protections against third parties *(ex. Browsers that prevent websites from tracking you)*

## 3 - Strong Security Protections üîê
Similar to privacy, this will mean different things in different contexts. Broadly, we do our best to select services that offer strong security protections from the service itself *(ex. Implementing zero knowledge encryption)* **and** that offer strong security protections against third parties *(ex. Sand-boxing its clients in a way that protects users)*

## 4 - Fast Security Patches üí®
Security patches are critical to keeping users secure in our ever-evolving world. We put a great deal of emphasis on them, and do our best to only recommend services that stay reasonably up-to-date with the latest threats.

## 5 - Public, Active Team üë•
We believe *(with few exceptions)* that teams behind services should be public & active. This allows users to know the history behind a service, adds accountability, and ensures there are real people dedicated to the service. Activity level is also important and speaks to the long-term sustainability of the service. We try to prioritize projects we feel have viable business models, with public & active teams who will exist in 5+ years.

## 6 - Efficient to Use üòå
Privacy & security mustn't inherently result in convenience or efficiency loss. Services which actively enable users to gain privacy & security in an efficient manner are generally prioritized. *(This can present itself as an issue in some of the following ways: difficult to install, difficult to setup, difficult to update, significant performance hit, requires certain hardware, etc.)*

## 7 - Easy to Use üëµ
Similar to the previous point, privacy & security shouldn't be challenging. We generally prioritize services we feel anyone - regardless of technical knowledge - can thrive using. Even seemingly small issues can mean a lot to some users *(ex. needing to download an app from a third-party app store, or sometimes we avoid listing services due to high cost when cheaper alternatives exist)* Additionally, we prioritize services offering quality customer support in the event users need individual assistance. This *can* take the form of a helpful community, though we prefer official customer support.

## 8 - Passed the Test of Time ‚è∞
Services come and go. Developers come and go. Ideas come and go. We appreciate services that have a consistently good history in prioritizing user safety. We prefer services with 3+ years of mostly positive history as a starting point for passing the test of time. One thing is announcing a new messenger, another is maintaining one for 5+ years. 

## 9 - Audited & Trusted ‚úÖ
Broadly, we do our best to list services that have been formally audited‚Äîpublicly, and/or have a great deal of trust within the privacy & security community. Trust is ultimately subjective and highly personal - which is why we take a broader approach to evaluating what's generally trusted by the community as a whole, in addition to analyses performed by experts.

## 10 - Evolving üìà
Lastly, we prefer services that are consistently evolving. User threats are growing in sophistication, and services that evolve with those threats are massively important to protecting users.
